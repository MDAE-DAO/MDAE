# MDAE
**Minima Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem**

## MDAE would be the Advertising Ecosystem that was meant to be.

The goal of this project is a Minima Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem where
everyone can be fairly rewarded and where advertisers can very simply offer a new method
of rewards/advertising or even selling to their customers using tokens, smart contracts,
DApps and a DAO. A truly Minima Decentralized Advertising System designed as a DAO ruled
as it would be a nonprofit organization in order not to swap one monopoly from another.
DAO - The DAO mainly would manage the distribution of the Tokens.
Acts as a non-profit organization.
Its purpose is a novel one: act as an incubator for promising minima projects
and attract investors to it, reward the developers, improve the system over
future and support scientific projects on green energies.

## DAO's GOALS

- Build and manage MDAE system and his tokens.
- Act as an incubator for promising minima projects.
- Attract investors to it.
- Reward the developers.
- Improve the MDAE system over future.
- Support scientific projects on green energies, specially **Hydrogen**.

## INCUBATOR Projects

- **DNS fully decentralized** over Minima where wallets, emails, DApps, webs IoT devices
can have a name.
- **Decentralize AI Machine Learning Models** that can be tokenized and Minima can be
used to verify that the model hasnâ€™t been tampered with hashing the data and saving
into tokens. 
So every minima node could act as a neuron or group of neurons to develope a
**AI model** decentralizing the machine learning model to run on each minima node.
  - One of the use cases, almost endless, was to guide a blind person using 
  the camera of his minima mobile and using external sources like GPS, and maps.
- **MinimaVerseDAO system** that can be used for Metaverse, Network States, Virtual 
worlds, games or even to rule a real country in a decentralized way.
Anyone, in case of a metaverse should own their piece of land, one piece of land for running minima node, where everything could be tokenized,
and with the tools provided from the DAO this "metaverse" could be one, multiples, or build the way their communities wanted.
  - The Idea with all that should be done:
