Fourth aproach ## ---> Contract on the Token <--- Solves all problems of visibility, concurrency and ownership:
----------------------------------------
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We have seen the problems if we take the aproach to send the tokens into an script and then when the user
(Advertiser) who install the DAO and register the script cannot see the tokens available on it, as they where
deposited before he registered the script on his node, and the same happens in the case a user wants to buy
tokens that are into script on the DAO, and the huge amount of tokens that would be tracked by all the nodes
implied with the script aproach and the concurrency problems that may arise.

To follow the other aproaches studied before taking this solution, you need to watch the document:
mdae_dao_script_problem_tests.txt which describe the aproaches and the tests done as well as the MDAE channel on
the discord Minima server MIC section.


####################
- ADVERTISER BUY TOKENS - ## The choosen solution: ##
####################

To avoid the problem of visibililty of the tokens, instead to use an script to deposit the tokens, we used
a wallet address hardcoded on the DAO app that points to the originalDAO's node (there could also be several
of them, decentralizing the original DAO between several different nodes, so the original DAO could have
a list of hardcoded addresses where to buy tokens) or in the future gather that list from an external source,
that way, instead of the Advertiser to ask for a token to be deposited into an script addres, directly ask for buy
the tokens, sending the total minimas needed to buy the tokens desired, to rule that behavior state variables
will be used set as described on ## SECOND APROACH ## and once the minimas have been received on the Original DAO's
address and all is checked, the tokens bought are sent to the advertiser wallet and the transaction is register on
the SQL database to avoid double buy problem.

Procedure:
 - Advertiser send the minimas to the wallet's DAO (original) needed to buy the desired token and all info needed to
 make the process possible.

  state_vars:
    0:[buy_tokens],
    1:wallet buyer,
    2:token to buy,
    3: amount to buy


######################
- MDAE SCRIPT OF TOKENS and How the system works - ## The choosen solution: ##
######################

  The whole tokens of the same type must be generated at once so they can have the same tokenid and then act
  as a full syncronized ecosystem, so, the script that rules the tokens must be set on the tokens itself
  instead on an script address(to avoid the problems of we described previsouly).

  This makes the script to build more complex, but every token can act independently and here we must
  consider how the system is going to deal with the rewards to be received by all parties when a token
  is spent and the problems that may arise, so lets to consider the followings things to get an an
  overview of the complexity:

  0.  DAO_Dapp it holds the tokens and several service as descrived on the MDAE project, but for the proof of Concept
      it will only hold the tokens to be bought by Advertiser's and send them to the VAULT (A multisig script) in the first
      place, then according to the demand the tokens of the VAULT will be moved to the DAO and splitted to avoid the problems of how
      UTXO system works as well as, on every bought of tokens, the minimas received are also sent to the VAULT and the
      DAO it also runs a background service on service.js that manages the buy of tokens when the DApp is not open
      on the Node where it is running.

  1.- When the advertiser has bought tokens he must configure them according to the campaign he wants to do,
      he will get that information from the TrackerDAPP, where users and developers register their addresses and
      DApps in order to be able to receive publicity.

      - The Adverstier using Advertiser_Dapp must configure the tokens of a particular campaign with all the information
      needed as state variables, until the token is not configured it cannot be sent to anyone.

      - Once the token is configured, the Advertiser must send the tokens of the campaing to the final users scripts,
      (every final user will have a unique script based on his wallet address and if there is a third party like a DAPP,
      the wallet of this DAPP(the developer)) as well as the rewards every party must receive when the token's Publicity
      is watched.

      - After a period of time,if the token of publicity has not been watched by final user, the Advertiser can claim
      the token(s) back and the rewards related to it/them and then configure them again for another campaing.

      - (If the exact amounts of rewards are not sent and the coinid of them is not tracked on state variables, then
      it may arise problems with the burn mechanism, as a final user may have several tokens and rewards on the same script,
      and when the token is spent it should spent the exactly rewards related to the token that were sent ), on this
      proof of concept we are not going to consider this scenario in order to simplify things.


  3.- TrackerDAPP This is de DApp that advertisers, developers of DApps and users would use to register their wallets or
      would gather information in case of Advertisers or let final users to watch the publicity tokens that are on
      their node.
      Two possibilities:

          1.- The TrackerDAPP will have the DAO wallet address hardcoded, as the DAO_Dapp have a service.js running in background
              it would also be used to save all data registered by TrackerDAPP.

          2-  The TrackerDAPP will have a wallet hardcoded and another DAPP(running on other node) that give support to TrackerDAPP
              that will have a service.js that will run in background and saves all data users, developers registers on SQL
              database as DAO_DApp does, as well as give information to Advertisers when they ask interachangin tokens with
              state variables(fractions of minimas).

      - Register users and Dapps of developers.

        - DApp (developer):
          The developer register his DApp with the wallet where he want to receive the rewards, the Name of the Dapp
          and the utility of his DApp (sports, news, technology, games, .....)

          Every developer DApp must include tracker.js API, that it must register the wallet of the developer and the wallet of
          the user, as with the wallet of the developer and the wallet of the user who has installed the DAPP, the API know if
          the user's node has received publicity tokens to be shown on this DAPP, as with these two wallets it generates
          a unique script address the same way the Advertiser will use the two wallets to know where to send the token and
          the rewards asociated with it.

        - Final User:
          The final user register his wallet where to receive the rewards that will come from watching publicity tokens.
          The final user also specify what topics he is interested on (sports, news, technology, games....)
          The final user also specify on which DApps, he has installed, wants to receive publicity.

        - The trackerDAPP will let to the final user to watch the publicity tokens that has been received on his node,
          as a tab or a popup, where the app show the tokens received and the user choose one token to watch his publicity.

        -Advertiser User:
          Will ask for information of users, dapps, and topics, and the TrackerDapp will use (DAO or other DAPP support)
          background services to ask and deliver that information directly to the Advertiser with a fraction of a minima with all
          info set as state variables. (this is a proof of concept, on a real system, Omnia could be used to transfer This
          information on a batch of tokens sent, as it can be very large amount of data, Maxima could also be considered, but it has problems too, but
          the must common aproach is to use an external service to deliver that data).

          There is a real possibility to use Maxima, as in this case it makes sense as there can be a lot of information to be
          transfered from SQL resuts of DAO background service.
          In that case, we can establish some kind of handshake protocol to transmit the MAXIMA contact between
          the Advertiser User and the DAO using the same system descrived earlier with state variables.
          Flow of Events:
            - Advertiser send a fraction of a minima to the DAO setting some state variables on it.
              - ** State 0 ** : [Data_query_advertiser] The advertiser tells DAO he wants some data.
              - ** State 1-5 ** : [data1, data2, data2....] a list of data the advertiser wants (topic, users, dapps,)
              - ** State 6-10** : [Maxima data contact] The Advertiser's Maxima contact splitted into several state vars if the size of it
                overflows the size of one state variable.
            - The DAO get the MAXIMA's contact of the advertiser and sets his contact.
            - The DAO send a MAXIMA message to Advertiser [Confirm connection] and waits for the answer of ADVERTISER
            - The DAO receives MAXIMA message [connection established] from Advertiser.
            - The DAO gets all data requestes by the Advertiser and encapsulate it on a JSON object and send the
              JSON object over maxima.
            - The Advertiser receives over MAXIMA the JSON object with the data requested.
            - The Advertiser uses that information to configure the Tokens for his advertisng campaign.
            
      -API tracker:
          It is a simple javascript, that the DAPPS that want to show token's publicity on the DAPP must include,
          the API when the app started for first time, uses the hardcoded developers address and ask for the user's wallet
          and with these two addresses register a unique script on the user node where the Advertisers will sent the
          publicity tokens and the rewards asociated with it.

          Then the API only checks for a NEWBALANCE event and checks if there is a publicity's token on this script's
          address and if one is found, the publicity of the token is shown in the part of the DAPP designed to show
          the publicity or a popup or whatever option is choosed.

          The API also checks if the publiciy is watched (easy option for now, it is clicked) and then trigger
          a javascript function that builds a transaction satisying all conditions set on the publicity token
          sending back to the DAO.

    4. Final user script.
      As we said earlier, the Advertisers sent the publicity tokens and rewards to the final user, on a script
      that is unique as is built with the user wallet or a combination of user wallet and Dapp(developer) address.
      So this script only controls that a token of publicity must be sent back to the DAO and the minima rewards
      must be sent to the VAULT as the user cannot extract the rewards manually, the rest of payment rewards and
      the comissions of the DAO will be checked by the TOKEN's script but the transaction must specify everyone of
      those requirements , otherwise it will fail.

    6.- Meaning and Setting the script variables
      - DAO:
        create n tokens
        the tokens must have an script that let the Advertiser to configure it, the script
        (the exchange contract for the final user)
        - Create the script into the tokens
          - conditions
            - vault address script ** state 0 **
            - publickey vaullt-1 ** state 1 **
            - publickey vaullt-2 ** state 2 **
            - publickey vaullt-3 ** state 3 **
            - Owner dao address ** state 4 **
            - Owner dao publickey ** state 5 **
            - Third party comission ** state 6 ** to be received by DAO when token is spent from the reward amount.
            - Final user comission ** state 7 ** to be received by DAO when token is spent from the reward amount.
            - If the rewards are not minimas, then a fix % must be set(according to the values of rewards-**Oracle**?)
              ** state 8 **
            - Price of Token ** state 9 **
            - buyer ** state 10 ** and amount ** state 11 ** must be set when the transaction is built.

      7.- Generating VAULT script address:

          Two publickeys are necessary to withdrow funds from the VAULT, the publickeys can be for now from the same nodes
          but in a real case they will be from three different people and nodes.

      8.- Transaction instructions to execute the buy of n tokens.
          Note:
          -The change back amounts must also been calculated and be included on the transactions as
          outputs, otherwise all amount of inputs that exceeds of the necessary quanity will be burn and not returned
          back to the owner of it, those cases are not done on the following example as I used the exact amount in order
          not to deal with change back, but it must be calculated and set on the transaction.

          -Note the coins to use on automated system, must be get from the command coins , watch if the coin contains
          enough quantity of minimas or Tokens, if none is found that meet the requirements then several input Coins
          must be used until the amount needed is met.
