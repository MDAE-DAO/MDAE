---DAPPS

1. DAO
Basic functionality very easy for starting, we are gonna add complexity over time.

- Script address to deposit the created tokens (Vault) very easy.
- Create the two basic tokens gDAE , aDAE and sent to Vault.
- Create very basic contract to let buy tokens by a third party (Advertisers, users.......).
	- Hard coded first version, 1 minima let buy 1 token.
	- Its an exchange contract, receive 1 minima and get 1 choosed token (state variable indicates which one)
	- Let buy advertiser tokens and profile tokens
	
2. ADVERTISER
	- Let user to configure his token (flashloan contract) first we can use state variables and only use text
		- Later we can think a way the publicity info is on a web page specify by the token state variable
	- Set a list of options of what the advertiser can configure about the token
		- Later we can think on to do it on a group of tokens.
		
3. PROFILE
	- Let a user configure his profile token (flashloan contract)
	- Set a list of options to configure the profile token as state variables
		- Later we can thing about encrypt it or hash it.
		
4. TRACKER
	- It is only a MOCK
	- Specify all options where Advertisers can configure where and how their tokens are gonna be published
	- Specify options to track information
	- Specify input/output/ORACLES sources.

---USE CASES

A. Publicity on a web page as a link or on a external DApp using minima or both of them.
	- The link on a web page using Maxima contact can be the most difficult and tricky as Maxima contact
	Info changes over time.
	- The use an external Dapp (that uses minima) can be simpler, as we could develope somekind of mini API
	that DApps should must import to look only on their nodes for receving specific publicity token.
	 
B. Publicity inserted dynamically into a game
	- Godot Game engine is waiting for a publicity token, when the token arrives to minima node's wallet then
	the game, if the player is near a publiciy zone for publicity, the game publish the publicity  on the game
	designated area.
	- With the experiments I did, it is almost done, 1-2 days of work at most.
