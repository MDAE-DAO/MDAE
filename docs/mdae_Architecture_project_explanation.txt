Fourth aproach ## ---> Contract on the Token <--- Solves all problems of visibility, concurrency and ownership:
----------------------------------------
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

We have seen the problems if we take the aproach to send the tokens into an script and then when the user
(Advertiser) who install the DAO and register the script cannot see the tokens available on it, as they where
deposited before he registered the script on his node, and the same happens in the case a user wants to buy
tokens that are into script on the DAO, and the huge amount of tokens that would be tracked by all the nodes
implied with the script aproach and the concurrency problems that may arise.

To follow the other aproaches studied before taking this solution, you need to watch the document:
mdae_dao_script_problem_tests.txt which describe the aproaches and the tests done as well as the MDAE channel on
the discord Minima server MIC section.


####################
- ADVERTISER BUY TOKENS - ## The choosen solution: ##
####################

To avoid the problem of visibililty of the tokens, instead to use an script to deposit the tokens, we used
a wallet address hardcoded on the DAO app that points to the originalDAO's node (there could also be several
of them, decentralizing the original DAO between several different nodes, so the original DAO could have
a list of hardcoded addresses where to buy tokens) or in the future gather that list from an external source,
that way, instead of the Advertiser to ask for a token to be deposited into an script addres, directly ask for buy
the tokens, sending the total minimas needed to buy the tokens desired, to rule that behavior state variables
will be used set as described on ## SECOND APROACH ## and once the minimas have been received on the Original DAO's
address and all is checked, the tokens bought are sent to the advertiser wallet and the transaction is register on
the SQL database to avoid double buy problem.

Procedure:
 - Advertiser send the minimas to the wallet's DAO (original) needed to buy the desired token and all info needed to
 make the process possible.

  state_vars:
  port == 0 operation
  port == 1 client_wallet_address
  port == 2 client_token_id
  port == 3 client_amount_desired
  port == 4 client_publickkey


######################
- MDAE SCRIPT OF TOKENS and How the system works - ## The choosen solution: ##
######################

  The whole tokens of the same type must be generated at once so they can have the same tokenid and then act
  as a full syncronized ecosystem, so, the script that rules the tokens must be set on the tokens itself
  instead on an script address(to avoid the problems of we described previsouly).

  This makes the script to build more complex, but every token can act independently and here we must
  consider how the system is going to deal with the rewards to be received by all parties when a token
  is spent and the problems that may arise, so lets to consider the followings things to get an an
  overview of the complexity:

  0.  DAO_Dapp it holds the tokens and several service as descrived on the MDAE project, but for the proof of Concept
      it will only hold the tokens to be bought by Advertiser's and send them to the VAULT (A multisig script) in the first
      place, then according to the demand the tokens of the VAULT will be moved to the DAO and splitted to avoid the problems of how
      UTXO system works as well as, on every bought of tokens, the minimas received are also sent to the VAULT and the
      DAO it also runs a background service on service.js that manages the buy of tokens when the DApp is not open
      on the Node where it is running.

  1.- When the advertiser has bought tokens he must configure them according to the campaign he wants to do,
      he will get that information from the TrackerDAPP, where users and developers register their addresses and
      DApps in order to be able to receive publicity.

      - The Adverstier using Advertiser_Dapp must configure the tokens of a particular campaign with all the information
      needed as state variables, until the token is not configured it cannot be sent to anyone.

      - Once the token is configured, the Advertiser must send the tokens of the campaing to the final users scripts,
      (every final user will have a unique script based on his wallet address and if there is a third party like a DAPP,
      the wallet of this DAPP(the developer)) as well as the rewards every party must receive when the token's Publicity
      is watched.

      - After a period of time,if the token of publicity has not been watched by final user, the Advertiser can claim
      the token(s) back and the rewards related to it/them and then configure them again for another campaing.

      - (If the exact amounts of rewards are not sent and the coinid of them is not tracked on state variables, then
      it may arise problems with the burn mechanism, as a final user may have several tokens and rewards on the same script,
      and when the token is spent it should spent the exactly rewards related to the token that were sent ), on this
      proof of concept we are not going to consider this scenario in order to simplify things.


  3.- TrackerDAPP This is de DApp that advertisers, developers of DApps and users would use to register their wallets or
      would gather information in case of Advertisers or let final users to watch the publicity tokens that are on
      their node.
      Two possibilities:

          1.- The TrackerDAPP will have the DAO wallet address hardcoded, as the DAO_Dapp have a service.js running in background
              it would also be used to save all data registered by TrackerDAPP.

          2-  The TrackerDAPP will have a wallet hardcoded and another DAPP(running on other node) that give support to TrackerDAPP
              that will have a service.js that will run in background and saves all data users, developers registers on SQL
              database as DAO_DApp does, as well as give information to Advertisers when they ask interachangin tokens with
              state variables(fractions of minimas).

      - Register users and Dapps of developers.

        - DApp (developer):
          The developer register his DApp with the wallet where he want to receive the rewards, the Name of the Dapp
          and the utility of his DApp (sports, news, technology, games, .....)

          Every developer DApp must include publicity-API.js API, that it must register the wallet of the developer and the wallet of
          the user, as with the wallet of the developer and the wallet of the user who has installed the DAPP, the API know if
          the user's node has received publicity tokens to be shown on this DAPP, as with these two wallets it generates
          a unique script address the same way the Advertiser will use the two wallets to know where to send the token and
          the rewards asociated with it.

        - Final User:
          The final user register his wallet where to receive the rewards that will come from watching publicity tokens.
          The final user also specify what topics he is interested on (sports, news, technology, games....)
          The final user also specify on which DApps, he has installed, wants to receive publicity.

        - The trackerDAPP will let to the final user to watch the publicity tokens that has been received on his node,
          as a tab or a popup, where the app show the tokens received and the user choose one token to watch his publicity.

        -Advertiser User:
          Will ask for information of users, dapps, and topics, and the TrackerDapp will use (DAO or other DAPP support)
          background services to ask and deliver that information directly to the Advertiser with a fraction of a minima with all
          info set as state variables. (this is a proof of concept, on a real system, Omnia could be used to transfer This
          information on a batch of tokens sent, as it can be very large amount of data, Maxima could also be considered, but it has problems too, but
          the must common aproach is to use an external service to deliver that data).
          Actually the DAO uses a Maxima aproach, but we haven't had time to test it.

          There is a real possibility to use Maxima, as in this case it makes sense as there can be a lot of information to be
          transfered from SQL resuts of DAO background service.
          In that case, we can establish some kind of handshake protocol to transmit the MAXIMA contact between
          the Advertiser User and the DAO using the same way descrived earlier with state variables.
          Flow of Events:
            - Advertiser send a fraction of a minima to the DAO setting some state variables on it.
              - ** State 0 ** : [Data_query_advertiser] The advertiser tells DAO he wants some data.
              - ** State 1-5 ** : [data1, data2, data2....] a list of data the advertiser wants (topic, users, dapps,)
              - ** State 6-10** : [Maxima data contact] The Advertiser's Maxima contact splitted into several state vars if the size of it
                overflows the size of one state variable.
            - The DAO get the MAXIMA's contact of the advertiser and sets his contact.
            - The DAO send a MAXIMA message to Advertiser [Confirm connection] and waits for the answer of ADVERTISER
            - The DAO receives MAXIMA message [connection established] from Advertiser.
            - The DAO gets all data requestes by the Advertiser and encapsulate it on a JSON object and send the
              JSON object over maxima.
            - The Advertiser receives over MAXIMA the JSON object with the data requested.
            - The Advertiser uses that information to configure the Tokens for his advertisng campaign.
            - The Advertiser confirms to the DAO that information is recevied [Information_received]
            - The DAO unsets Advertiser MAXIMA's contact from his node as there is a limit on how many contacts
              a node can manage.

      -publicity-API.js:
          It is a simple javascript, that the DAPPS that want to show token's publicity on the DAPP must include,
          the API when the app started for first time, uses the hardcoded developers address and ask for the user's wallet
          and with these two addresses register a unique script on the user node where the Advertisers will sent the
          publicity tokens and the rewards asociated with it.

          Then the API only checks for a NEWBALANCE event and checks if there is a publicity's token on this script's
          address and if one is found, the publicity of the token is shown in the part of the DAPP designed to show
          the publicity or a popup or whatever option is choosed.

          The API also checks if the publiciy is watched (easy option for now, it is clicked) and then trigger
          a javascript function that builds a transaction satisying all conditions set on the publicity token
          sending back to the DAO.

        -The SHOW-PUBLICITY-DAPP shows that aproach, if no publicity token is detected, it shows a basic image,
          if a publicity token is detected it show the image of the token and once clicked it makes a transactions
          and payback to all parties theirs piece of cake according to the state variables set on the token.

    4. Final user script.
      As we said earlier, the Advertisers sent the publicity tokens and rewards to the final user, on a script
      that is unique as is built with the user wallet or a combination of user wallet and Dapp(developer) address.
      So this script only controls that a token of publicity must be sent back to the DAO and the minima rewards
      must be sent to the VAULT as the user cannot extract the rewards manually, the rest of payment rewards and
      the comissions of the DAO will be checked by the TOKEN's script but the transaction must specify everyone of
      those requirements , otherwise it will fail.

          back to the owner of it, those cases are not done on the following example as I used the exact amount in order
          not to deal with change back, but it must be calculated and set on the transaction.

          -Note the coins to use on automated system, must be get from the command coins , watch if the coin contains
          enough quantity of minimas or Tokens, if none is found that meet the requirements then several input Coins
          must be used until the amount needed is met.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Due to the problems we had with scripts, we lost two weeks trying to make them work as they are very tricky
not only on the script part but also when marking the transactions, so we decided, not to use the script on
the token, only on the final user part where the publcity token will be sent (this final address is a unique
address script composed by the wallet of the Developer who built the DAPP the user is using and the user wallet
address), so keeping always on every send and transaction all info on the state variable it let us to rule the
system as it would be an script checking for things are right, but of course it could be cheated, but the aproach
using the state variables is the same with or without a script.

-Dapps of the Ecosystem:
  - DAO-Dapp: It manages to keep track of the petitions to buy tokens, to register users profiles and wallets and
  developers Dapps and wallets and also deliver the tokens bought by a buyer to his address setting all necessary
  state variables.

  - Advertiser-Dapp:
    It let buy tokens of pubicity to the DAO, and it let configure a group of tokens according to a
    specific campaign, the only working solution tested and that works is to use an url image to configure
    the campaign, although probably the text version should also work, but we didn't have time to do it.
    So when configuring a campaign, the app, sets all old state variables previously set on the token and also
    set all state variables related to campaign, that way, no info is lost, and all state variables are needed to
    later pay all parties his rewards to watch the publicity.

    So if you send by hand a configured token with the Advertiser-Dapp to the final user script, the example
    app SOW-PUBLICITY-DAPP will detect it, and will show the publicity info and if clicked, will do the payments
    rewards and commissions to all parties.

  - Tracker-Dapp it let users and developers register their addresses and profiles and send that info to the
  DAO to save it to the SQL database.
  The tracker DAPP also let a final user that is no using any other DAPP to watch the publicity tokens received
  on his node.

  -DeveloperMaxSoloDAPP+API: it is the maxsolo with a publicity image added by default.
  -SHOW-PUBLICITY-DAPP is a full working app to show developers how to use his api (publicity-API.js) to show
  the publicity of the tokens when they arrive to the user node and show up on specific part of the DAPP, once clicked
  on the publicity image, a transaction is triggered and all parties receives his money and commissions and the Token
  is sent back to the DAO and the commissions of minimas for the quantity of the user and developer are sent to the
  VAULT.

  !! Due to the problems we had with the scripts, we lost more than two weeks trying to make them work, but they
  are very ticker, so we couldn't finish all project at a time  the way we wanted,so the syncronization with
  all Dapps it dosen't work completely, as there are parts that need to be hardcoded, like the DAO wallet on
  some Dapps, the tokenid of advertising tokens, the Vault script to be built and the tokens of Advertising with
  all right state variables since the begining, it makes the project hard to test if you are not a developer who
  can set all those steps.

  So, on most of them in order to work, you must send the tokens is all necessary state variables set to the specific
  addresses to trigger the behavior of some DAPPS, like the SHOW-PUBLICITY-DAPP , just a couple of more days and we
  could have synchronized all correctly.

################# CONCLUSION  and ROAD MAP ########################
###################################################################

- The possibilities of this project are huge, we didn't have enough time to develop all parts as we wished,
but, just with the parts we have done, even if trigger manually, it shows a great potential.
So , finally , most of the MDAE project has bee done only by two developers, one at full time and other with
dedicating to it his free time, and the third one just started the UDPOI project a few days ago, so in the
future maybe we should need some reinforcements, so if the project is not funded, then it will be hard to get
those reinforcements, as the project is complex and there are lots of possibilities to explore, including Artificial
Intelligence and third parties integration.
As we presented a lot of documentation and very deep, the road map stays the same way it was designed, just a couple or
a few days more and we should have finish a fully working project with five Dapps and a game fully syncronized AND
working together.
